These challenges require socat to be installed. On ubuntu, you can just run:

    sudo apt-get install socat

These are scripting challenges. In each directory, you will find a run.sh file. This script will create a socket and listen on port 1234. When a connection is made to the socket, the executable in that directory will be run and you may interect with it through the socket. 

For each challenge, open up a terminal and run the run.sh script. Then open up another terminal and write a python script that will connect to the socket, recieve a line, and send the proper input through the socket. Your python scripts should have the lines 

HOST = localhost 
PORT = 1234

remember: you have to add a new line character at the end of your payload
